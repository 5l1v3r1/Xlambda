# libwm

A small library for X window manipulation

## documentation

Here is the full list of all the function you can use from `libwm`:

    init_xcb();
    kill_xcb();
    is_alive(wid);
    is_ignored(wid);
    is_listable(wid, mask);
    is_mapped(wid);
    get_screen();
    get_windows(wid, **list);
    get_attribute(wid, attr);
    get_cursor(mode, wid, *x, *y);
    set_border(width, color, wid);
    set_focus(wid);
    set_cursor(x, y, mode);
    teleport(wid, w, h, x, y);
    move(wid, mode, x, y);
    resize(wid, mode, w, h);
    restack(wid, mode);

Their usage is specified in the `wm.h` header file, as it is quite small for
now.

## installation

`libwm` provides two files: libwm.a and wm.h.  
You can build/install them as follow:

    $ make
    # make install

The makefile supports 2 macros: DESTDIR and PREFIX.

Then to link your program against it, compile it as follow:

    cc pgm.c -lwm -o pgm
